Imago is Latin for "Image".

Imago is a small header only project for an image class along with
reading images from and writing images to disk.

# Install
* Imago is as said a header only project, so all you need to do is copy the header files into your repo (imago and the stb_image headers).

# How to use
* Before including the "imago.h" header, `#define IMAGO_IMPLEMENTATION`
